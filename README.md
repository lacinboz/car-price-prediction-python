# Car Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict car prices based on various features. The dataset includes both categorical and numerical variables. The goal is to build a predictive model that can estimate car prices accurately. I evaluated multiple algorithms to determine which one achieved the best accuracy.

## Data Exploration
- **Data Loading:** The dataset used is from Kaggle. [Car Price Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hellbuoy/car-price-prediction)
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Summary statistics for numerical variables are computed.
- **Categorical Variables:** Analysis of unique values in categorical variables.

## Data Preprocessing
- **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Categorical variables are one-hot encoded.
- **Feature Scaling:** Numerical features are scaled.
- **Data Splitting:** The dataset is split into training and testing sets.

## Feature Engineering
- **Creating New Features:** New features are derived from existing ones.
- **Feature Selection:** Important features are selected based on their correlation with the target variable.

## Model Training
- **Model Selection:** Various algorithms are evaluated.
- **Training the Model:** The chosen model is trained.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Hyperparameters are optimized.

## Model Evaluation
- **Performance Metrics:** MSE and R-squared are reported.
- **Cross-Validation:** Cross-validation techniques are used.

## Usage
- **How to Run the Code:** Execute cells in the notebook to reproduce results.
- **Dependencies:** Ensure required libraries are installed (e.g., numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib).
